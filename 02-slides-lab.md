# I want to have a _command line utility_ installed
# So that I can _deploy apps into cloud.gov_

^ We have our login, now how do we run stuff? With a CLI

---

# Why the `cf` CLI?

The Cloud Foundry command-line interface (CLI) is a multiplatform binary written in `Go` to interact with the _CF API_.  The CLI provides:

* Automation
* Collaboration
* Corroboration

^ You can put commands into files, with variables, and then run them.<br> You can share code by viewing text files, or even copy/paste, in ways you can't with GUIs (nb: skip Snover anecdote). <br> And with version control you can corroborate that the change you mean to make is the change expressed by the code. <br> With the dashboard we provide overview tools and roles/permissions since those may be needed by project managers how are not using the CLI day-by-day


---

# Lab 2: Install cloudfoundry tools and login to cloud.gov

---
# 2.1 Select and install the appropriate installer for your computer: 

Go to [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) and select an `Installer` for your system. Download and go through the installation steps.

On Macs, with Homebrew, you can use: 

```sh
     brew cask install cloudfoundry-cli
```

On Workspaces, `cf` CLI is already installed.

^ I have not shown the Installer steps as they're different for different systems, and should be familiar to you at this point.

---

# 2.1 continued...

After the installer has finished, run the command:

```sh
> cf
``` 

and you should see a list of command options.

^ When you have CF installed and working as on the next slide, we'll continue with authenticating your CLI to your _cloud.gov_ account.

---

# Check your work 2.1

You should see output similar the to the following:

```sh
PS /Users/peterburkholder> cf
cf version 6.26.0+9c9a261fd.2017-04-06, Cloud Foundry command line tool
Usage: cf [global options] command [arguments...] [command options]

Before getting started:
  config    login,l      target,t
  help,h    logout,lo

... [snip] ...
```

^ Instructor: wait here until most partipants have CF installed.

---

# 2.2 Login to cloud.gov with the _cf_ CLI

You'll enter the command below, and you'll be directed to an _authentication URL_. 

```powershell
cf login --sso -a https://api.fr.cloud.gov
```

Confirm you're logged in by seeing the _orgs_ you belong to:

```powershell
cf orgs
```

---

# Check your work 2.2

```
> cf login --sso -a https://api.fr.cloud.gov
API endpoint: https://api.fr.cloud.gov

One Time Code ( Get one at https://login.fr.cloud.gov/passcode )>
```

Visit the URL [https://login.fr.cloud.gov/passcode](https://login.fr.cloud.gov/passcode), complete the login to _cloud.gov_, and you'll get a one-time passcode. Copy/paste the passcode back into the CLI, as show [in this 30s video](https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-public/cg-otp-login-fast.mp4)

# Lab 3: Download _workshop labs_ and deploy a _static website_ to _yourname_.app.cloud.gov

Our simplest example. We'll get our _lab materials_, then use `cf push` to send the files to _cloud.gov_.  Cloud.gov will package the site and start to serve it.

^ We have working environment, a cloud.gov account, a working `cf` connection to the cloud.gov account. Now we need to materials for the rest of our labs. Then we can release a website.

---

# 3.1: Download labs 

Mac/Linux shell:

```shell
cd $HOME
curl -Lo cgw.zip http://bit.ly/cgw-zip
unzip cgw.zip
cd cg-workshop-master

Windows Powershell:

```powershell
cd $HOME
iwr -o cgw.zip https://bit.ly/cgw-zip

cd cg-workshop-master
```

^ Instructor: Run through the entire set of slides then wait for participants to catch up

# Lab 3.2: Deploy static website

Don't literally use _myfname-lname_ below. Use your own name like, _jane-doe_:

```
cf push -f lab03-site/manifest.yml myfname-lname

You can skip doing _cf push_ as we'll pick up from there in the next section.

# I want to run a _dynamic webapp_
# So that users can _interact_ with us

---

# Lab 4: Sinatra Application

We'll use _cf push_ again, but this time to _stage_ and run a dynamic web application. We'll see how to use the _manifest.yml_ to set deployment options.

The manifest provides application _metadata_ to CloudFoundry. We use it for non-default settings so we don't have to always specify them on the command line, and we can bundle the manifest with the application.

^ As with static site, let's review the slides, then we'll pause for everyone to run the commands<br> Sinatra is a _ruby_ web framework. The deployment process is the same for any supported Cloud Foundry language.  <br>First, let's revisit and update what happens with CF PUSH:

---

[.build-lists: true]

# What happens when I _cf push_? (v2.0)

* Upload: **App** files are sent to CF for new app _myfname-lname_
* Staging: 
  * **Executable** artifact is created (droplet)
  * **All build dependencies are bundled into _droplet_**
* Running: 
  * A _route_ is created to the **app** ~~site~~
  * ~~Site~~ **App** starts on an ~~web~~ **app** host
  * ~~Site~~ **App** serves web requests **(if it binds to TCP port)**

^The staging step of bundling _build dependencies_ is part of the _buildpack_ job, as we'll discuss in a moment. Also, apps can also run without binding, or listening, on a network port. These are _worker_ applications that's don't directly serve traffic. Will Slack will mention those with Federalist.  

---

# Buildpacks create a runnable artifact called a droplet

App Files + Runtime Dependencies = App Artifact (droplet)

# Apps are started on specialized VMs called cells

If itâ€™s a web process, it binds to a TCP port
Instances are distributed across multiple cells
Router distributes traffic across instances

^A couple points about how CF pulls things together  <br>If you look at the labs04-app/Gemfile you'll see a lot of dependencies that the buildpack handles. Buildpacks can be used so there are no online dependencies in your application push.  <br>The apps run in container instances that can be migrated between cells for resource management and uptime.

# Further exploration

Once you've visited your app and viewed `cf app cglab`, try the following:

* Run `cf buildpacks`. What languages are available by default?
* Uncomment the `manifest.yml` line with `buildpack`, then run `cf push` and check status with `cf app cglab`. What's changed in staging or application status?
* Does the updated manifest change release time? Try `time cf push` (shell) or `Measure-Command {cf push}` (powershell)

# I want to store data in a service
# So that it is persistent and shared

---

# Lab 5. I can share persistent data between app instances

First we'll see the _services_ available to us in the _marketplace_, then use _create-service_ to provision a simple Redis data store. 

We'll then _bind_ that service to our application.  

Our application wll use its _environment variables_ to determine its connection information

---

# Lab 5.1 Review the available _services_

Run the command below. How many Redis _services_ are there?

```
   cf marketplace

Examine `redis32` service details with the `-s` option.

# Lab 5.3 Associate service and app with _bind-service_

The app, _cglab_ needs to know about _cglab-redis_. The _bind-service_ shares service information by setting _environment variables_ in the app container.

Run: 

```
   cf bind-service cglab cglab-redis

View the environment variables in the app with:

```
   cf env cglab

# Lab 5.5 Scaling

Since CF stores executable artifacts and runs them in containers, you can quickly _scale_ your app to meet demand.

Scale _cglab_ to two instances:

```
   cf scale cglab -i 2

Immediately, refresh the _cglab_ webapp page multiple times.

How long until a new instance was available?

Once you've seen the app count visits per scaled instance:

* Go to your app's URL + '/env": http://cglab....app.cloud.gov/env[^2]
* Can you use `cf set-env` to add new variables?
  * Hint: You'll need `cf restage` for your app to pick them up.
* Try scaling the app to four, then back to two. Which instances are kept?
* Can you scale to zero?

[^2]: These environment variables are deliberately exposed by the app for demonstration purposes. You would never have this feature in any _real_ app.
