# I want to have a _command line utility_ installed
# So that I can _deploy apps into cloud.gov_

---

# Why the `cf` CLI?

The Cloud Foundry command-line interface (CLI) is a multiplatform binary written in `Go` to interact with the _CF API_.  The CLI provides:

* Automation
* Collaboration
* Corroboration

^ You can put commands into files, with variable, and then run them. You can share code by viewing text files, or even copy/paste, in ways you can't with GUIs. And with version control you can corroborate that the change you mean to make is the change expressed by the code.

---

# Lab 2: Install cloudfoundry tools and login to cloud.gov

---
# 2.1 Select and install the appropriate installer for your computer: 

Go to [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) and select an `Installer` for your system. Download and go through the installation steps.

On Macs, with Homebrew, you can use: 

```sh
     brew cask install cloudfoundry-cli
```

On Workspaces, `cf` CLI is already installed.

---

# 2.1 continued...

After the installer has finished, run the command:

```sh
> cf
``` 

and you should see a list of command options.

---

# Check your work 2.1

You should see output similar the to the following:

```sh
PS /Users/peterburkholder> cf
cf version 6.26.0+9c9a261fd.2017-04-06, Cloud Foundry command line tool
Usage: cf [global options] command [arguments...] [command options]

Before getting started:
  config    login,l      target,t
  help,h    logout,lo

... [snip] ...
```

---

# 2.2 Login to cloud.gov with the _cf_ CLI

Try the built-in help:

```sh
cf login --help
```

Then, login:

```sh
cf login --sso -a https://api.fr.cloud.gov
```

---

# Check your work 2.2

You should see output similar to the following:

```

Our simplest example. We'll use `cf push` to send the files to cloud.gov, and it'll package the site and start to serive it.

# 7. I can share persistent data between app instances

our application.  Our application we'll use its _environment variables_ to determine
the connection information
