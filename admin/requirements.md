## Equipment requirements

For the workshop (remote or on-site), you have three options for participation.

### Option 1. A government-furnished computer (GFE) that meets the following requirements for "Local cloud.gov tools"

The "Local cloud.gov tools" requirements are:
* Windows 7 and higher, or macOS 10.10 and higher
* Ability to install and run the [Cloud Foundry command-line client](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html), version 6.0 and higher.
  * We will have time to download and install the client during the workshop.
* Recommended: Ability to install and run a [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Option 2. If allowed by your agency: A personal computer that meets the above requirements.

If your agency allows you to use a personal computer for this workshop, you can use a personal computer that meets the above "Local cloud.gov tools" requirements. You won't be accessing any of your agency's resources other than your email for initial cloud.gov account registration.

### Option 3. A Remote Virtual Workstation - advance notice required

If you can't use "Local cloud.gov tools," we can provide a Remote Virtual Workstation. This won’t provide the full experience of the Local cloud.gov tools, but will suffice for our workshop. To connect to the Remote Virtual Workstation, your computer should have:

* Computer: Window 7 or higher, or Mac OsX 10.10 
* Browser: Firefox version 49 and higher, or Chrome version 53 and higher
* Optional: the [Amazon Workspaces Client](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/)
