The actual workshop is 9:45 until 11:30, or 1h45m. We have 2h30m. I expect to run into problems that I won't have next week because: you found the bugs for me.  Also, I'll cut some content based on your feedback.

Please read this doc: and ignore it entirely like your typical person who neglects email.

I'm going to ask you play certain roles:

Yourself with your GSA laptop
yourself@cao.gov with a new cloud.gov account in `sandbox-cao` and your GSA laptop
yourself@cao.gov with a new cloud.gov account in `sandbox-cao` and using AWS Workstation with AWS Workstation client
yourself@cao.gov with a new cloud.gov account in `sandbox-cao` and using AWS Workstation with the Firefox client

AWS Workstation users: Please have Mac Activity Monitor running so we can see how much bandwidth the clients need.
