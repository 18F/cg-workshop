[Equipment requirements/setup:](./admin/requirements.md)

All these examples will work on any of Windows 8 or above, MacOsX, or Linux, but the testing and development have all be validated on OsX/bash and Windows10/powershell.

To make the examples as portable as possible, I've used common Powershell-Unix aliases such as `cd`, `cat` and `more`, in place of `Set-Location`, `Get-Content`, `Out-Host -paging`  and so on.
