# Why a workshop?

- Demonstrate the cloud.gov
  - Workflow
  - Architecture
- Not a training course, an appetizer
  - Enough that you could use a _sandbox_
- Enough cloud.gov 
  - thay you'll ask more questions, and
  - that you'll pursue for _your_ agency

^ This section takes about 10m, then 5m to wait for most of the participants to reach the dashboard

---

# As federal PM/Developer/CISO,
# I want some hints on logistics 
# So that I can participate in the workshop

^ We're not printing these slides since mostly screenshots. User Stories FTW! Once we complete the static website lab we'll take a ten-minute break, and get some guidannce to those who are having trouble, since this is the part of the morning with the most _variance_

---

Have visible:
- The `powershell` (Windows), 
   `iterm`(Mac) or `terminal` (Mac) window
- The webpage with YouTube Live
- The webpage with [lab notes](https://github.com/18F/cg-workshop/blob/master/01-slides-setup.md)
  [https://github.com/18F/cg-workshop/blob/master/01-slides-setup.md](https://github.com/18F/cg-workshop/blob/master/01-slides-setup.md) 
See next page for example

If you're using an Amazon Workspace
- Use your local browser for YouTube, Notes
- Don't use the webclient, unless you must
- Set up your Workspace and `powershell` as in the following video

---

_Video of setting up Amazon Workspace TK_

^ This starts from getting your invitation. Note that native client is preferred, this video shows the web client. The password is different from any other password you're setting up/using today. This just shows one way to get your computer set up for the workshop. Play and continue

---

# I want a _cloud.gov account_
# So that I can use _cloud.gov_

^ At this point you have your computer set up with browser windows and a terminal or powershell window.

# 1. Sign up for an account

Let's assume you don't have an account,
and aren't with GSA, EPA or FDIC.

I'll walk through these steps. 

If you already have an account, please make sure you can reach:
