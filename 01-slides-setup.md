# Why a workshop?

- Demonstrate the cloud.gov
  - Workflow
  - Architecture
- Not a training course, an appetizer
  - Enough that you could use a _sandbox_
- Enough cloud.gov 
  - thay you'll ask more questions, and
  - that you'll pursue for _your_ agency

^ This section takes about 10m, then 5m to wait for most of the participants to reach the dashboard

# As federal PM/Developer/CISO,
# I want some hints on logistics 
# So that I can participate in the workshop

^ We're not printing these slides since mostly screenshots. User Stories FTW! Once we complete the static website lab we'll take a ten-minute break, and get some guidannce to those who are having trouble, since this is the part of the morning with the most _variance_

# Have visible:

_terminal_ (Mac) window
